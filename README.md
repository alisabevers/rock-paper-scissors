# Rock, Paper, Scissors, SHOOT!

## Description
This Codecademy mini-project required me to code a rock, paper, scissors game. 

## Instructions
After cloning the repo to your local machine, simply run the following command in your terminal: ```node main.js```.

You can change the value of the userChoice in line 49 of the main.js file. Based on the value which you assign to userChoice, the computer will generate a response and a winner will be determined. 

Enjoy!
